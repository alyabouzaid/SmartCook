# SmartCook

### Project Description: 
Love to cook but always struggle to come up with ideas? SmartCook is a web app designed for all food lovers who enjoy cooking, exploring new recipes, creating recipe journals, and socializing about food/cooking. It is not just a standard recipe recommendation app. It is an app that keeps track of your ingredient inventory (almost like an online fridge) and recommends you different recipes based on the type of food you like and the ingredients you have on hand. Also, SmartCook allows you to save and customize your favourite recipes into your personal recipe journal. You can upload food pictures and create group chats to communicate on meal planning and vote for your favourite food pictures. The data that will be stored in SmartCook includes recipes, user’s ingredient inventory, user's recipe journal, user account information, chat history, and food pictures uploaded by users. If time allows, we would like to add an online grocery shopping feature that allows users to order groceries online (e.g. Instacart). Both the online grocery shopping and the group chat feature may be added/removed based on time constraint.
